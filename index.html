                    <p>
                        Hi! My name is Isaac Mack and I am a front-end web developer who enjoys sports, biking, video games, and of course creating websites. I have 3 years of experience working remotely and contributing to large projects. I am familiar with creating content from scratch, themes, and through CMS' such as WordPress.<br><br>
                        I have experience using several JavaScript frameworks as well as pure JavaScript. One of my best qualities would have to be that I am a quick learner! My time at IIT as well as my individual study and practicing has allowed me to be able to pick up on new things very quickly. I am currently looking to add to my skillset and portfolio.

                    <h1>SKILLS</h1>
                    <p>
                        <u>HTML/CSS</u>: I am very comfortable using HTML and CSS to set up and style web pages. I have experience building from scratch as well as editing templates.<br><br>
                        <u>JAVASCRIPT</u>: I have experience coding in pure Javascript as well as using frameworks such as Bootstrap. I make sure to practice Javascript regularly and have included a few small projects I worked on.<br><br>
                        <u>TESTING/DEBUGGING</u>: Bugs are inevitable when coding. I have experience finding and improving problem areas of my code.<br><br>
                        <u>RESPONSIVE DESIGN</u>: We are in the age of smart phones, so it is important that sites look good across devices. The websites I created are responsive and designed to look good on all devices. I am continuing to improve my skills in this area.

                    <p>
                        I built the A-K Auto Mechanic website based on the client's design from scratch using Bootstrap and the Google Maps API. The site is responsive and functional. I also included some Search Engine Optimization to help it to be displayed higher in search results.

                        I recently became interested in game development using HTML/CSS/Javascript and this is my first project I started in that area. It's a small demo of a game where you give commands to a robot and he executes them one at a time. My original idea was to create a game geared toward younger children as an intro to coding, relating it to giving commands to a robot and introducing loops and other coding fundamentals along the way. I built it from scratch using Javascript to handle all the functionality. Made use of async/await to make the robot execute one step at a time and not all at once. More will be added to the project over time.
